__doc__ = """The `Cross-Quantilogram`(CQ) is a correlation statistics that measures the quantile dependence between two time series. It can test the hypothesis that one time series has no directional predictability to another. Stationary bootstrap method helps establish the asymptotic distribution for CQ statistics and other corresponding test statistics."""
